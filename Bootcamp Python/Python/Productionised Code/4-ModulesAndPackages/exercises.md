1. Create a Math Package:
- Create a package named math_operations.
- Inside the math_operations package, create a module named arithmetic.
- Define functions addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in the arithmetic module that perform the respective operations on two numbers and return the result.

2. Import and Use Module:
- Create a new Python script named math_analysis.py outside the math_operations package.
- Import the arithmetic functions from math_operations.arithmetic.
- Use each arithmetic function with sample numbers.
- Print the results.

3. Conditional Execution:
- Add a conditional statement in math_operations to print a message when the module is executed as a script.
