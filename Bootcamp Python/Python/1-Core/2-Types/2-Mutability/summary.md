# Summary

Some datatypes in Python are mutable, and others are immutable:

- **Mutability**: If an object's value can change and keep the same ID.
  - Lists
  - Dictionaries
  - Sets
- **Immutability**: An object's value cannot be changed once it is set. That ID and value are paried, and any new values must belong to a new object with a different ID.
  - Integers
  - Floats
  - Strings
  - Tuples
  - Frozensets
