    "# Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression (or regex in short) is a string that defines a search pattern. Regular expressions can be used to search for specific patterns within a given text. Regular expressions have been used for well over 50 years, with the American pioneer of Computer Science, Kenneth Lane Thompson, creating the foundational notations that many variants of regular expressions still use today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expression patterns are typically agnostic of programming languages and operating systems. Unix-based systems have made use of the `grep` (**g**lobally search for a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint matches) command line utility function to search for one of more regex patterns in a given set of files and provide the results where these patterns are successfully matched in any of the input files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use of regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expression patterns are available for use in a wide range of tools and languages. For example, Microsoft Word allows us to search using simple wildcards in a word document. Certain patterns can also be used in command line utilities (e.g. PowerShell in Microsoft Windows or Terminal in MacOS) to search and list a set of files matching the wildcard pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Windows PowerShell,\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ls *.txt` will list all the files with the extension 'txt' in the current folder (or no output if no matches are found)\n",
    "- `ls t*` will list all files and folders beginning with the letter 't' in the current folder (or no output if no matches are found)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wildcards, while strictly not the same as regular expressions provide us a flavour of how they work. More powerful regex patterns can be used in a range of programming languages such as Python, SQL, Java or Perl. For example, Python has a built-in module **re** for handling regular expressions. These regex patterns can be used to search through a body of text for a variety of purposes - for example, when validating a particular field of data or when trying to apply data enrichment using find and replace methods. The core patterns in regular expressions are universal, however, different tools have their own regular expression engines to process regex patterns and these engines can have different behaviours and levels of support for more complex patterns. These variations are known as regex flavours.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regex patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Regex patterns are used to describe the target sequence to be matched. They can be formed by combining a number of different components (as detailed below). Regex patterns are matched from left to right and the leftmost match is always returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Literal characters\n",
    "\n",
    "These include precise matches to the characters. A few examples are given in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Description                |\n",
    "| ------- | -------------------------- |\n",
    "| t       | Matches the letter 't'     |\n",
    "| toast   | Matches the string 'toast' |\n",
    "| 4       | Matches the number 4       |\n",
    "| 123     | Matches the number 123     |\n",
    "\n",
    "Several characters can be matched at the same time by placing them within square brackets. This also works for a range of characters. Negation can be performed by including a `^` (caret) symbol at the beginning (within the square brackets).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern  | Description                                         |\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Several flavours allow restriction matching to [ASCII encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). In this case, `\\d` is the same as `[0-9]` and `\\w` is the same as `[A-Za-z0-9_]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metacharacters\n",
    "\n",
    "These are special characters that need to be escaped (preceded) with a backslash in order to be matched literally. Some examples are **+ (plus), ^ (caret), ? (question mark), $ (dollar), \\* (asterisk), \\. (dot)**. These metacharacters have a special meaning when used without escaping as given in the table below. These characters can also be used along with multiple characters (by placing after the character set or after the square brackets above). When placed inside the square brackets, the metacharacters are matched precisely without the need for escaping.\n",
